# AI Virtual Mouse üñ±Ô∏èüß†

This application implements an AI-powered virtual mouse using Eel, enabling users to control their mouse cursor using gestures or commands detected by the AI model.

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The AI Virtual Mouse allows users to interact with their computer by simulating mouse movements and clicks based on user input processed through an AI model. It provides an intuitive way to navigate and control applications using gestures or voice commands.

## Features üöÄ

- **Gesture Recognition:** Detects hand gestures or movements to control the mouse cursor.
  
- **Voice Commands:** Responds to voice commands for specific actions like clicking or scrolling.
  
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides visual feedback or alerts based on AI model predictions.
  
- **Configurable Settings:** Allows users to customize sensitivity, gesture patterns, and voice command preferences.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python:** Backend logic and AI model integration.
  
- **Eel:** Web frontend for displaying UI and interacting with users.
  
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision library for gesture recognition.
  
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Machine learning framework for AI model training.
